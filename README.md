# chinese-number-test
This is a web-based Mandarin Chinese numbers test.  [Try a live example here.](https://chinese-number-test.karikas.com/)

The idea here is you tap or click on a number, and you have three seconds to say it... before your device will say it for you.  It's like flash cards, for yourself!

Born out of a need to have something better than actual flash cards for my daughter who is learning Chinese.  This was all my wife's idea and I think it's a good one!

Written in HTML with just a little javascript and jQuery.  Upload this to a folder on a web server and you're ready to go.

The audio is taken from the [Wikibooks page on Chinese Numbers](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chinese_(Mandarin)/Numbers).
